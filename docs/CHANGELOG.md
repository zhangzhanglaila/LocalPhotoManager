## 🚧 Unreleased — macOS Rendering, Map Runtime & Location Resilience

🖥️ *A platform-compatibility pass focused on macOS Metal/QRhi previews,
transparent-window map rendering, safer location assignment, and packaged
runtime coverage.*

### Key Updates

#### 🍎 macOS Media Rendering
- Added platform QRhi backend selection via `IPHOTO_RHI_BACKEND`; macOS now
  prefers Metal when Qt exposes it, while Windows and Linux keep the OpenGL path.
- Added a QRhi-backed image/video adjustment renderer with QSB shader assets for
  image preview, crop overlay, LUTs, and adjusted-video frames.
- Routed macOS long-press video previews through the RHI popup path so adjusted,
  rotate-only, and plain previews share the stable GPU surface.
- Improved high-DPI crop and pan math by converting logical viewport
  coordinates through the actual QRhi render-target scale.

#### 🗺️ Maps Runtime & macOS GL Stability
- Added macOS OsmAnd runtime discovery for `dist-macosx` helper/widget builds
  and a `scripts/sync_macos_map_extension.py` workflow that copies resources,
  search data, `.dylib` binaries, dependencies, rpaths, and ad-hoc signatures.
- Switched the macOS legacy GL map to `QOpenGLWindow + createWindowContainer()`
  to avoid transparent `QOpenGLWidget` FBO composition in the frameless main
  window.
- Hardened map surfaces with opaque backing colors, full-update repaint
  behavior, optional `IPHOTO_MAP_GL_DEBUG` diagnostics, and GL marker rendering
  inside supported map passes.
- Extended standalone map preview backend selection with explicit
  `auto/native/python/legacy` modes and runtime diagnostics.

#### 📍 Assign Location Resilience
- Assign Location now persists the selected place to `global_index.db` even when
  ExifTool is missing or the original file metadata write fails.
- Added user-facing warnings for missing ExifTool or failed GPS write-back while
  keeping the local database assignment intact.
- Sanitized metadata updates before JSON storage so non-serializable third-party
  values cannot corrupt asset rows.

#### 📦 Packaging & Tests
- Updated the Windows Nuitka script to bundle QRhi image/overlay/video shader
  assets and the `maps` package alongside the maps extension.
- Added regression coverage for render backend selection, macOS map GL surface
  formats, native map widget event targets, RHI overlay rendering, map runtime
  sources, macOS extension sync, location assignment fallback, preview windows,
  and worker-side image scaling.

## 🚀 v6.0.0 — People, Face Clusters, Groups & Linux Maps Runtime

👥 *A major People release with automatic face clustering, persistent People
state, multi-person groups, richer location metadata, and broader Windows/Linux
runtime packaging.*

### Key Updates

#### 👥 People Face Clusters
- Added the optional **People face-scanning pipeline** powered by InsightFace
  and ONNXRuntime through the `ai-demo` extra.
- Detects faces in image assets, writes cropped face thumbnails, builds face
  embeddings, and clusters them into persistent People cards.
- Added background face-scan scheduling alongside the normal asset scan, with
  `pending`, `done`, `skipped`, `retry`, and `failed` status tracking in the
  global asset index.
- Rebuilt the People persistence model around a rebuildable runtime snapshot
  plus stable People state so names, covers, ordering, hidden flags, and group
  decisions survive rescans and reclustering.

#### 👨‍👩‍👧 People Groups & Dashboard Workflow
- Added **People groups** for collecting photos where multiple selected people
  appear together.
- Group cards support shared-photo queries, cover selection, drag ordering,
  pinned state, and safe disbanding without deleting the underlying people or
  photos.
- Added People card actions for naming, merging, hiding/unhiding, cover
  management, and dashboard filtering for hidden people.
- Hardened merge safety so hidden and visible people cannot be merged by
  accident.
- Split the People dashboard into focused board, card, dialog, shared, and
  widget modules for easier testing and future iteration.

#### 🗺️ Location & Info Panel Improvements
- Added an embedded location map to the floating info panel so geotagged assets
  can show map context directly in metadata view.
- Added location assignment plumbing and background tasks for updating selected
  asset coordinates.
- Improved map source handling, OsmAnd search support, and map widget runtime
  behavior.
- Extended Linux maps support with helper-backed OBF rendering and the native
  OsmAnd widget runtime when the required shared libraries are present.

#### 🧩 Albums, Menus & Pinned Items
- Added persistent pinned-item services for albums, people, and groups.
- Expanded sidebar and gallery context-menu plumbing with shared menu styling
  and consistent action handling.
- Improved album dashboard/sidebar behavior, cover actions, rename/delete
  workflows, and album tree model coverage.
- Added project popup guardrails so routine warnings and confirmations use the
  app-themed popup system instead of native `QMessageBox` surfaces.

#### ⚙️ Scanning, Indexing & Packaging
- Improved the scan pipeline with chunked persistence, scan-merge behavior, and
  global repository tests for move/delete and status preservation scenarios.
- Added People cover caching and thumbnail cache services for faster dashboard
  rendering.
- Updated Nuitka and Debian packaging guidance for bundled `insightface`,
  `onnxruntime`, `extension/models`, Linux maps runtime files, and People-page
  release smoke tests.
- Added troubleshooting guidance for packaged face-scan failures, runtime typing
  compatibility issues, model-cache problems, and Linux XCB/GLX map startup.

#### 🧪 Tests & Reliability
- Added focused coverage for People pipeline clustering, People repositories,
  People service behavior, People dashboard widgets, group workflows, hidden
  state, merge guards, and cover persistence.
- Added tests for info panel maps, map extension download tasks, gallery and
  playback coordinators, album sidebar/model behavior, scan/index sync, and
  Linux map source handling.
- Improved packaged-runtime diagnostics so asset-level face failures are logged
  and retried without deadlocking the full People scan.

## 🚀 v5.0.0 — Video Editing, Trim System & Platform Stability

🎬 *Full non-destructive video editing, a visual trim timeline, centralized keyboard shortcuts, and a sweeping round of Linux/GL stability fixes.*

### Key Updates

#### ✂️ Video Editing Workflow
- Introduced a **complete non-destructive video editing suite** powered by a smooth OpenGL-accelerated preview pipeline.
- Added a **visual trim timeline** with thumbnail strip, draggable in/out handles, and real-time playhead clamping inside the trim range.
- Trim in/out points are saved to the sidecar file and **persist across app restarts**; the gallery duration badge now reflects the trimmed length.
- **Playback progress bar** is remapped to the active trim range so the scrubber always tracks the visible portion of the clip.
- Fixed stale progress bar after returning from edit mode — duration is force-synced when the video is reloaded.
- Added **video transport keyboard shortcuts** (seek, play/pause, frame-step) inside the video edit panel.
- Simplified the video edit sidebar section layout for a cleaner editing experience.

#### ⌨️ Centralized Keyboard Shortcuts
- Introduced **`AppShortcutManager`** — a single class that owns all application-level keyboard bindings, eliminating duplicated shortcut setup across components.
- **Space bar** play/pause now works reliably in both gallery view and detail view.
- Added full **gallery-mode video shortcuts**: volume up/down, mute toggle (M key), and playback controls.
- Fixed M-key mute shortcut registration; renamed shortcut volume constant for clarity.

#### 🔍 Zoom Handle in Gallery / Detail View
- Added a **resize/zoom handle** in the video header bar so users can adjust the preview size directly from the gallery and detail view without entering edit mode.
- Zoom state is emitted via `zoomChanged` and properly synced when switching renderer surfaces or clearing a frame.

#### 🐧 Linux GL Playback Stability
- Fixed a **critical black-screen bug** in adjusted (edited) video playback on Linux caused by Qt's QRhi context not owning the OpenGL state needed by the custom GL renderer.
- Aligned the Linux QRhi GL viewer with the Qt GL context; used Qt GL functions for VAO creation with an automatic fallback when QRhi rejects VAO binds.
- Hardened GL matrix uniform uploads and stabilized video frame dispatch on the GUI thread to eliminate flicker and rotation artifacts on Linux.
- Snapshots non-packed video frames before uploading to prevent intermittent corruption.
- Fixed Linux edit-preview viewport sizing and queuing of frames to avoid dropped frames during playback.

#### 🖼️ Crop Overlay & Edit Transition Fixes
- Fixed **crop overlay disappearing** when the overlay VAO was unavailable — the renderer now falls back to default vertex-array state so the orange crop frame always renders.
- Cleared stale pre-existing GL errors before binding the overlay VAO; those errors were silently disabling the overlay on Linux.
- Restored correct **crop-frame fade behavior**: the orange border always remains visible; only handles and guides are suppressed in faded state.
- Deferred restoration of the detail chrome and filmstrip until the edit-exit animation fully completes, preventing layout jumps.
- Respected the user's filmstrip visibility preference when leaving edit mode.
- Fixed video canvas proportions after exiting edit mode by using `crop_center_zoom_strength=1.0` in detail/non-edit mode.

#### 🎞️ Video Metadata & Info Panel
- Implemented **multi-level cross-brand lens extraction** for both video and image assets — the info panel now resolves lens model, focal length, and aperture from multiple ExifTool fields across all major camera brands.
- ExifTool is invoked during video playback enrichment to populate lens/focal-length fields that are absent from the media container.
- Fixed normalization of raw `LensInfo` tuples (e.g. `"23 23 2 2"`) into human-readable strings (`"23mm f/2"`).
- Eliminated duplicated focal-length/aperture suffixes when the lens string already contains mm notation.
- Fixed the `ƒ` aperture format in the info panel display.

#### 🐛 Fixes of major bugs
- Fixed video rotation not refreshing immediately when changed in playback mode.
- Fixed `ExternalToolError` not being caught explicitly during playback metadata enrichment, preventing silent failures.
- Fixed `_restore_detail_video_preview` to correctly use `video_requires_adjusted_preview` and pass raw adjustments on the native render path.
- Fixed out-point reset when re-entering edit mode — `PlaybackCoordinator` now guards trim remapping in edit mode.
- Fixed SHA-1 usage in temp file naming replaced with **SHA-256** for stronger stability guarantees.
- Fixed GL `glBindTexture` redundancy before `glGenerateMipmap` calls.
- Used `ctypes c_uint` GL id buffers to avoid numpy dtype warnings on Windows.
- Fixed `QShortcut` parent widget to use the top-level window instead of a nested widget, preventing shortcuts from silently failing.
- Fixed several other minor bugs and improved overall stability.

#### 📦 Packaging & Installer Integration
- Aligned local development, Nuitka packaging, and the Windows installer around the same extension directory contract.
- Documented how the extension is synchronized into packaged builds and optional installer assets.
- Made Windows release work more reproducible by standardizing which runtime artifacts ship with the application.

#### 🧰 Upstream Build Workflow
- Split the OsmAnd runtime build pipeline into the dedicated
  [PySide6-OsmAnd-SDK](https://github.com/OliverZhaohaibin/PySide6-OsmAnd-SDK) side project.
- Added clearer developer documentation for building, syncing, and validating the maps extension from the upstream workspace.
- Improved the handoff between runtime experimentation in the side project and release packaging in the main iPhotron repository.

## 🚀 v4.1.0 — MVVM Refinement & Major Scrolling Performance Boost

📸 *A more complete MVVM foundation with dramatically smoother scrolling and more stable large-library browsing.*

### Key Updates

#### 🏗️ MVVM Architecture — More Complete, More Stable State-Driven UI
- **Stronger MVVM boundaries:** Clearer responsibilities across View / ViewModel / Model reduce cross-layer coupling and implicit dependencies.
- **Upgraded state management:** Standardized UI State (`Loading / Content / Empty / Error`) helps prevent edge-case rendering divergence.
- **More consistent unidirectional data flow:** The View only subscribes to ViewModel outputs, while all mutations enter through the ViewModel.
- **Better testability:** Critical logic moved into ViewModel plus UseCase/Service layers for finer unit testing and safer regression coverage.
- **Lifecycle & resource governance:** Subscriptions and async tasks are properly scoped and disposed with lifecycle events to reduce leaks and background overhead.

#### ⚡ Scrolling Performance Boost — Dramatically Smoother Browsing
- **Lighter rendering pipeline:** Reduced unnecessary re-renders and layout recalculations for steadier high FPS while scrolling.
- **Enhanced virtualization for lists and grids:** Improved visible-range computation and reuse strategy to lower UI workload on large datasets.
- **Smarter thumbnail loading:** Prefetching and prioritization now focus on on-screen items, with progressive loading and better decode scheduling.
- **Cache improvements:** Multi-level caching (`memory + disk`) with smarter eviction stabilizes hit rate and reduces redundant decoding.
- **Async task coordination:** Better debouncing and coalescing for rapid scroll events helps avoid main-thread contention and request storms.
- **Lower memory churn:** Fewer transient allocations during fast scrolling reduce GC/ARC pressure and micro-stutters.
