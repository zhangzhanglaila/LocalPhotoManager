# Contributing to iPhoto

Thank you for your interest in contributing to iPhoto! We are building a folder-native, non-destructive photo manager that respects your data and filesystem.

## 1. Introduction

### Welcome & Purpose
iPhoto aims to bring a polished macOS *Photos*-inspired experience to Windows,
macOS, and Linux while preserving a strict "Folder = Album" philosophy. We
prioritize data integrity, performance, and a seamless user experience without
locking you into a proprietary database.

### Code of Conduct
Please note that this project is released with a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## 2. Development Setup

### Prerequisites
*   **Python**: Version 3.12 or higher.
*   **External Tools**: You must have the following tools installed and available in your system `PATH`:
    *   `ExifTool`: For reading/writing metadata.
    *   `FFmpeg` (and `ffprobe`): For video processing and thumbnail generation.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OliverZhaohaibin/iPhotron-LocalPhotoAlbumManager.git
    cd iPhotron-LocalPhotoAlbumManager
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Install the package in editable mode along with development dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```
    This command installs `pytest`, `ruff`, `black`, `mypy`, and other necessary tools.

## 3. Core Philosophy & Data Integrity

Our design philosophy is strict to ensure user trust and data safety:

*   **Folder-Native Principle**: "Folder = Album". We do not import photos into a database. The filesystem is the source of truth.
*   **Non-Destructive Editing**: We never bake crop/color/video edits into source files (HEIC, JPG, MOV, etc.). The explicit exception is Assign Location, which saves the chosen place to the local index and best-effort writes GPS metadata through ExifTool after the user confirms the action.
*   **Manifest Files**: User decisions such as covers, starring, ordering, and edits are stored in sidecar or state files like `.iphoto.album.json`, `.ipo`, and People state databases.
*   **Disposable Cache With Stable User State**: The system must be robust enough to rebuild `global_index.db` (SQLite database), `links.json`, thumbnails, and the runtime People face snapshot when needed. Do not treat cache as persistent storage. People names, selected covers, hidden flags, groups, group order, pinned state, and group covers are user decisions stored in stable People state and must not be discarded during cache repair or rescans.
*   **Optional People AI Runtime**: Face clustering uses the optional `ai-demo` dependencies (`insightface` and `onnxruntime`). Core photo management must remain usable when those dependencies are not installed.

## 4. Project Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture to separate core logic from the GUI.

### Layered Architecture
*   **Domain Layer** (`src/iPhoto/domain/`): Pure domain models and repository interfaces, framework-independent.
*   **Application Layer** (`src/iPhoto/application/`): Business use cases and application services coordinating domain logic.
*   **Infrastructure Layer** (`src/iPhoto/infrastructure/`): Concrete implementations (SQLite repositories, metadata providers).
*   **Core Backend** (`src/iPhoto/`): Pure Python logic including models, I/O, core algorithms, and cache management. Has **no** dependencies on PySide6 or any GUI libraries.
*   **GUI Layer** (`src/iPhoto/gui/`): The frontend implementation using PySide6 (Qt6) following MVVM pattern with coordinators and view models.
*   **Maps Module** (`src/maps/`): Semi-independent offline map runtime with legacy vector tiles, helper-backed OBF rendering, and native OsmAnd widgets.
*   **Facade Pattern**: `app.py` acts as the backend facade, while `gui/facade.py` bridges the backend to the frontend using Qt signals/slots.

### Module Responsibilities
*   `domain/`: Domain entities (`Album`, `Asset`) and repository interfaces (`IAlbumRepository`, `IAssetRepository`).
*   `application/`: Business use cases (open album, scan album, pair Live Photos) and application services.
*   `infrastructure/`: SQLite repository implementations, database connection pool, metadata services.
*   `models/`: Legacy data classes (dataclasses) and manifest I/O.
*   `io/`: Filesystem scanning, metadata reading, and sidecar writing.
*   `core/`: Algorithms for pairing Live Photos, sorting, filtering, and image adjustment resolvers (light, color, B&W, curves, selective color, levels).
*   `cache/`: Management of global SQLite database (`global_index.db`), migrations, recovery, and file-level locking.
*   `people/`: Face detection/clustering pipeline, rebuildable People snapshot, stable People state, names, covers, hidden people, and groups.
*   `maps/`: Offline map sources, runtime discovery, map widgets, native OsmAnd bridge, and standalone map preview entry point.
*   `utils/`: General utilities and wrappers for `ExifTool` and `FFmpeg`.
*   `gui/coordinators/`: MVVM coordinators managing view navigation and business flow.
*   `gui/viewmodels/`: View models for data binding and presentation logic.

## 5. Coding Standards

### Style Guide
*   **Linting & Formatting**: We use `ruff` for linting and `black` for formatting.
*   **Line Length**: Limit lines to **100 characters**.
*   **Compliance**: Ensure your code passes `ruff check .` and `black --check .`.

### Typing
*   **Strict Type Hints**: All functions and methods must have type annotations.
    *   Use `Optional[str]`, `list[Path]`, etc.
    *   Run `mypy .` to verify type safety.

### Error Handling
*   **Custom Exceptions**: Use the exceptions defined in `errors.py`. Do not raise bare `Exception` or `ValueError` unless absolutely necessary for internal logic.

### File I/O Safety
*   **Atomic Writes**: Always write to a temporary file (e.g., `.tmp`) and then rename it to the target filename to prevent data corruption during crashes.
*   **Locking**: Before writing to manifests or index files, check `.lexiphoto/locks/` (or equivalent) to avoid race conditions.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Use `pathlib.Path` for all file path manipulations to ensure compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 6. Performance & Optimization Guidelines

Performance is critical for handling large photo libraries.

### Optimization Hierarchy
1.  **NumPy Vectorization** (Highest Priority): Use NumPy array operations for full-image manipulations or batch data processing. This utilizes SIMD and is much faster than loops.
2.  **Numba JIT**: Use `@jit(nopython=True)` for pixel-level loops or complex logic that cannot be vectorized.
3.  **Pure Python/Qt** (Last Resort): Use standard Python loops or Qt API calls only when the above are not applicable.

### Memory Efficiency
*   **In-Place Operations**: Use the `out=` argument in NumPy functions (e.g., `np.clip(..., out=arr)`) to avoid creating unnecessary copies of large image arrays.

### Benchmarks
*   Always measure performance before and after optimization to ensure your changes actually provide a benefit.

## 7. Graphics Guidelines

The detail view, video preview, edit preview, and map components use
platform-specific GPU rendering. Windows and Linux keep the established OpenGL
paths; macOS media previews default to QRhi/Metal when available, and the
legacy macOS map uses `QOpenGLWindow + createWindowContainer()` to avoid
transparent-window `QOpenGLWidget` composition issues.

### Coordinate Systems
We define four distinct coordinate spaces. **Do not mix them up.**

1.  **A. Texture Space** (0-1): The persistent storage space. Used in `.ipo` sidecars. Unaffected by rotation.
2.  **B. Logical Space** (0-1, with Aspect Ratio): The space for user interaction (Python UI layer). Handles rotation and flips.
3.  **C. Projected Space**: The space **after** perspective transform but **before** rotation. **Crucial** for black-border detection.
4.  **D. Viewport Space**: Screen coordinates (pixels). Used only for handling mouse inputs.

### Crop Logic
*   **Projected Space**: All crop validation (ensuring the crop box is inside the image) must happen in **Projected Space**.
*   **Shader Pipeline**: The Fragment Shader handles geometric transformations in this order: Perspective -> Crop Test -> Rotation -> Texture Sampling.

### GPU Standards
*   Use **OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile** where the raw GL path is active.
*   Use QRhi backend selection for media preview widgets; `IPHOTO_RHI_BACKEND=auto` should choose Metal on macOS and OpenGL elsewhere.
*   Keep QRhi shader assets (`image_viewer_rhi.*`, `image_viewer_overlay.*`, `video_renderer.*`) included in packaged builds.
*   Use `QSurfaceFormat` to request the correct map GL format. On macOS maps, keep alpha/depth/stencil settings aligned with `MapGLWindowWidget` unless a real GUI regression test proves a different surface model.

## 8. Testing Strategy

### Running Tests
Run the test suite using `pytest`:
```bash
pytest
```

### Robustness
*   Tests must simulate missing or corrupt files to ensure the application handles them gracefully without crashing.
*   **Rebuildability**: Verify that deleting `global_index.db` or `links.json` results in them being correctly rebuilt by the system through re-scanning.
*   **People State Safety**: When changing face clustering, merges, covers, hidden people, or groups, verify both repository behavior and GUI behavior. Stable People state must survive rescans and runtime snapshot rebuilds.

    <body>
    ```
*   **Subject Line**:
    *   Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
    *   Limit to 50 characters.
    *   No period at the end.
*   **Body**:
    *   Wrap lines at 72 characters.
    *   Explain *what* and *why*, not *how*.

## 11. Code Review Guidelines
